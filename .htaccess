# This translates the header added by an upstream proxy (eg, a load balancer) which terminates SSL.
# WP expects a variable HTTPS, but the proxy gives us another indicator. We need to map the two.

# The condition: if the header X-Forwarded-Proto has the value https, set the environment variable HTTPS to "on"
RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-Forwarded-Proto} https
RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTPS:on]

# Next, unless the protocol is already https, redirect to the https version.
# This will catch anyone trying to access via http

# I don't think it's possible to check the environment variable we may have set above, because it's not been set yet. 
# Instead, check the header again
